General Information
===================

scrivi is a small and lightweight UTF-8 text editor for the GDE2
environment. Based on gedit, the text editor for the GNOME2 environment.

scrivi is part of GDE2 and uses the latest GTK+ and GDE2 libraries.
Complete GDE2 integration is featured, with support for Drag and Drop (DnD)
from Caja (the GDE2 file manager), the use of the GDE2 help system,
the GDE2 Virtual File System and the GDE2 print framework.

scrivi uses a Multiple Document Interface (MDI), which lets you edit more than
one document at the same time.

scrivi supports most standard editing features, plus several not found in your
average text editor (plugins being the most notable of these).

scrivi plugins may also be written in the python scripting language: to enable
python support you need the pygtk and gde2-python-desktop bindings.

Although new features are always under development, currently scrivi has:

    * Complete support for UTF-8 text
    * Syntax highlighting
    * Support for editing remote files
    * Search and Replace
    * Printing and Print Previewing Support
    * File Revert
    * A complete preferences interface
    * Configurable Plugin system, with optional python support


Some of the plugins, packaged and installed with scrivi include, among others:

    * Word count
    * Spell checker
    * Change case of selected text
    * File Browser
    * Automatic snippet expansion
    * Sort
    * Insert Date/Time
    * External Tools
    * Tag list

Other external plugins are also available.

Installation
============

scrivi requires GTK+-2.16.x, GtkSourceView 2.4.x and Gde2Conf libraries.
PyGobject 2.12.x, PyGtk 2.12.x and PyGtkSourceView 2.4.x are required to
enable python plugins support.

Simple install procedure:

  % gzip -cd gde2-text-editor.tar.gz | tar xvf - 	# unpack the sources
  % cd gde2-text-editor				# change to the toplevel directory
  % ./autogen.sh				# run the `configure' script
  % make					# build scrivi
  [ Become root if necessary ]
  % make install				# install scrivi


Running Tests
==================
Scrivi has several test that can be run after compilation. Run them by issueing "make check". However there are a couple of requirements that need to be satified before they will pass.

* You need the gsettings schemas installed for some tests to be able to run.
* You need to mount sftp://localhost/ with gvfs-mount for one test to pass.

If test fail and you have setup the above correctly then please file a bug report as described below.

How to report bugs
==================

Bugs should be reported to the GDE2 bug tracking system.
(https://github.com/gde2-desktop/scrivi/issues). You will need to create an
account for yourself.

You can also report bugs using the GDE2 program bug-buddy.

In the bug report please include:

* Information about your system. For instance:

   - What operating system and version
   - What version of X
   - What version of the gtk+, glib and gde2 libraries
   - For Linux, what version of the C library

  And anything else you think is relevant.

* How to reproduce the bug.

* If the bug was a crash, the exact text that was printed out when the
  crash occurred.

* Further information such as stack traces may be useful, but is not
  necessary. If you do send a stack trace, and the error is an X error,
  it will be more useful if the stack trace is produced running the test
  program with the --sync command line option.
